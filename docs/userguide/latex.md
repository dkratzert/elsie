# Latex
*Elsie* can render LaTeX directly into your slides. You need to have `pdflatex` and `pdf2svg` 
installed for this to work. LaTeX code can be rendered using the
[`latex`](elsie.ext.latex.latex) function.

You can find an example of `LaTeX` usage with *Elsie*
[here](https://github.com/spirali/elsie/blob/master/examples/latex/latex.py).
